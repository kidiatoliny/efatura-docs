# Workflows

This guide shows the package-level flows used by production integrations. The examples assume `efatura` was created with `createEfatura(config, dependencies)`.

## Build And Validate An Invoice

```ts
const invoice = efatura.validateInvoice(rawInvoice);
```

The invoice parser normalizes values, applies document-type compatibility rules, applies local fiscal rules, and returns `InvoiceData`. Invalid data throws `EfaturaValidationError`.

Use the builder when the app creates documents directly:

```ts
const invoice = efatura
  .invoice()
  .type('FTE')
  .issueDate('2026-02-08')
  .receiver({ taxId: { countryCode: 'CV', value: '900800700' }, name: 'Receiver' })
  .lines(lines)
  .totals(totals)
  .validate();
```

## Allocate A Fiscal Number

```ts
const documentNumber = await efatura.nextDocumentNumber(invoice.issueDate, invoice.type);
```

The number is scoped by transmitter NIF, year, LED code, and document type. Configure a durable sequence store before using this in production.

If the application does not need to inspect the number first, build the IUD directly:

```ts
const iud = await efatura.buildSequentialIud({
  issueDate: invoice.issueDate,
  documentType: invoice.type,
  randomCode: '1234567890',
});
```

## Build XML

```ts
const xml = efatura.buildDfeXml(invoice, {
  documentNumber,
  randomCode: '1234567890',
});
```

`buildDfeXml()` validates issue-date tolerance and contingency consistency before building XML.

Use `iud` instead of `documentNumber` when the fiscal number was generated elsewhere:

```ts
const xml = efatura.buildDfeXml(invoice, { iud });
```

## Validate XML Against XSD

```ts
const result = await efatura.validateDfeXml(xml, invoice.type);

if (!result.valid) {
  throw new Error(result.errors.map((error) => error.message).join('\n'));
}
```

Configure `XmllintXsdValidator` or another `XsdValidator` implementation before relying on this check.

## Sign XML

```ts
const signed = await efatura.signDfeXml(xml, {
  certificate,
  privateKey,
});
```

The default signer produces XAdES-BES signatures and returns signed XML plus signature metadata.

## Package ZIP

```ts
const zip = efatura.buildDfeZip([{ iud, xml: signed.xml }]);
```

Each file is written as `{IUD}.xml` using Deflate compression.

## Submit Through Middleware

```ts
const result = await efatura.submitDfeZip(zip);
```

This uses `middlewareBaseUrl` and `transmitterKey` from config. The response is normalized into request metadata, document-level results, and errors when the service returns structured payloads.

## Submit Through Platform

```ts
const result = await efatura.submitDfeZipToPlatform(zip, {
  accessToken,
});
```

This uses `platformBaseUrl` from config unless `baseUrl` is supplied in options. Use this path only where the app owns PE token handling.

## Render DFA

```ts
const dfa = await efatura.renderDfa({
  iud,
  invoice,
  currency: 'CVE',
});
```

When `invoice` is supplied, the renderer receives parties, issue data, line summaries, taxes, totals, QR code URL, and contingency data. When only `iud` is supplied, the renderer can still create an IUD-only document.

## HTTP Adapter Flow For SPAs

Browser clients should call an authenticated application server. They must not receive transmitter keys, certificates, private keys, PE tokens, or DNRE credentials.

Typical SPA flow:

1. POST `/efatura/dfe/xml` with `{ invoice, options }`.
2. POST `/efatura/dfe/validate/fiscal-readiness` when the user needs readiness feedback.
3. POST `/efatura/dfa` with `{ iud, invoice, options }` to preview the PDF.
4. POST `/efatura/dfe/zip` after XML is approved for packaging.
5. Submit from the server side only.

See [Fastify Server Example](examples/fastify/server.md) and the SPA examples under `docs/examples/fastify`.

## Recovery Flow

If a submission fails before the official platform accepts the document, keep the generated IUD, XML, ZIP payload, and transport response. Do not allocate a replacement number until the operational process decides that the original fiscal document number can no longer be used.
