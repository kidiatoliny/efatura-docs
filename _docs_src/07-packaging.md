# Packaging

DFE transmission uses ZIP files containing compact XML documents. The implementation lives in `src/application/packaging` because packaging is an application use case, not a core contract and not a presentation adapter.

## Files

```text
src/application/packaging/
  crc32.ts      CRC32 calculation for ZIP records
  dfe-zip.ts    Deflate ZIP writer for DFE XML files
```

## ZIP Rules

`buildDfeZip()` accepts a list of DFE XML files:

```ts
const zip = efatura.buildDfeZip([
  { iud, xml },
]);
```

Each XML file is written into the archive as `{IUD}.xml`, using Deflate compression. The helper validates IUDs before writing filenames.

## Transport Split

Packaging is separate from transport:

- `buildDfeZip()` only creates the ZIP payload.
- `MiddlewareTransport` submits ZIP payloads to a local middleware instance.
- `PlatformTransport` submits ZIP payloads to the official PE API using OAuth bearer tokens and repository headers.

This split keeps packaging deterministic and easy to test with internal package fixtures. Official DNRE golden vectors for ZIP payloads were not found in the published artifacts.

## Responses

Fetch-based middleware and platform transports normalize JSON and XML service responses into:

- `requestId`, `correlationId`, and `receivedAt`, when the response carries envelope metadata.
- `documents`: DFE-level results such as IUD, status, code, message, repository code, authorization code, validation code, processing timestamp, and raw payload.
- `errors`: service or validation errors with code, message, field, severity, details, and raw payload.

If the HTTP response fails without a structured error body, the transport records the HTTP status as a submission error.
